You goal is to update any vulnerable dependencies.

Do the following steps:

1. Run `npm audit` to identify any vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies.
2. Review `npm audit fix` to apply updates to fix vulnerabilities automatically.
3. Run tests and verify that the application works as expected after the updates.
4. Clean up any unnecessary dependencies or files created during the audit process.
